## Overview

Egypt’s Trains is a mobile application designed to help users search for train trips between different Egyptian cities. The app allows users to select departure and destination stations, choose train types, apply filters, and view available train results.

Although the app provides the required functionality, the original design had multiple usability and interface issues that negatively affected the user experience. This project focuses on analyzing the application as a complete system and redesigning it using Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to improve usability, clarity, efficiency, and user satisfaction.

## Features

* Search for train trips between Egyptian cities
* Select departure and destination stations
* Choose train types
* Apply filters to search results
* View available train options

## Purpose of Redesign

* Improve usability and navigation
* Reduce cognitive load for users
* Enhance clarity and visual hierarchy
* Ensure a smooth and complete user flow
* Provide a modern and professional user experience

## Technologies and Tools

* Figma for UI design and prototyping
* HCI principles for UX improvements

## Target Users

* Daily commuters
* Occasional travelers
* First-time users with varying technical experience

## Results

The redesigned application provides a more user-friendly and efficient experience, allowing users to complete tasks faster and with less effort while following HCI best practices.
